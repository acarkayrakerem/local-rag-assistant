# 🤖 Local Ollama RAG Assistant

A fully local AI chatbot with a web-based interface, powered by
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** and **Ollama**. This assistant runs
completely offline (optional) and can answer your questions based on the
documents you upload — including PDFs, Word files, text files, and more.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **100% Local & Private**: Your documents stay on your computer. No data
  needs to leave your machine.
- 🧠 **Smart RAG Pipeline**: Built using **LangChain**, **ChromaDB**, and
  **Hugging Face embeddings** to understand your documents.
- 🗂️ **Multi-Format Support**: Works with PDFs, Word docs (`.docx`), `.txt`,
  `.md` and more.
- 💬 **Gradio Web Interface**: Clean, easy-to-use chat interface running in your
  browser.
- 📚 **Source Citations**: Tells you exactly which file the answer came from.
- 🧪 **Test Data Included**: Comes with a `test_DB` of synthetic employee data
  to try immediately.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. **Open in Browser:** You will see a message like
   `Running on local URL: http://127.0.0.1:7860`. Click the link to open the
   chat.

## 💡 How to Use

1. **Select Provider**:
   - Choose **`ollama(free)`** for unrelated local privacy.
   - Or choose OpenAI/Google/Anthropic if you have an API key.
2. **Select Database**:
   - Click the 📁 File Explorer icon.
   - Navigate to your document folder.
   - **Important**: To select the current folder, click the **folder icon with a
     `.` (dot)** next to it.
3. **Vectorize**:
   - Click **"Vectorize The Database"**. This reads your files and creates the
     "brain" for the AI. No need to do it again, unless you want to update the
     database.
4. **Chat**:
   - Ask questions like _"Who has an AWS certificate?"_ and get answers based on
     your files!

## 🧪 Sample Data

Included is a `test_DB` folder with synthetic employee records generated by
**Gemini 2.5 Flash**. You can point the database selector to `test_DB` to test
the app right away!

## ❓ Troubleshooting

- **`NameError: ChatOllama is not defined`**: Run
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` again to ensure all new dependencies are
  installed.
- **Ollama connection failed**: Ensure the Ollama app is running and you pulled
  `llama3.2`.
- **Missing files**: Check the allowed file types in `ingest.py`.
